# OtterScreenAdapter

It turns out that modern screens/panels like the LP097QX1-SPA1 from LG have a eDP interface, which is only DP (DisplayPort) but without a standard connector. You can buy such a screen for ~40€ and with the OtterScreenAdapter (part cost: ~10€) you can convert it into an external 2048x1536px monitor.
